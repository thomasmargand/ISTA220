1. What is a method?

A method is a named sequence of events, or a method is a named location in memory that references a behavior.

2. What does a return statement do?

A return statement causes a method to return information at the end of the processing in the method body. A return statement consists of the keyword return followed by an expression that specifies the returned value and a semicolon. The type of the expression must be the same type as the type specified by the method declaration.

3. What is an expression bodied method?

A simplified form for methods that comprise a single expression. These methods can still take parameters and return values, and they operate in the same way as the methods that you have seen so far.

4. What is the scope of a variable?

The scope of a variable is simply the region of the program in which that variable is usable.

5. What is an overloaded method?

If two identifiers have the same name and are declared in the same scope, they are said to be overloaded.

6. How do you call a method that requires arguments?

The syntax for calling a method that requires arguments is:
   `methodName(arg1, arg2, arg3)`

7. How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, that requires a parameter list?

The syntax for writing a method is:

 `returnType methodName( paramaterList)
{
//method body
}`

8. How do you specify a parameter as optional when defining a method?

You specify that a parameter is optional when you define a method by providing a default value for the parameter. You indicate a default value by using the assignment operator.

9. How do you use pass an argument to a method as a named parameter?

To pass an argument as a named parameter you specify the name of the parameter  followed by a colon and the value to use.
